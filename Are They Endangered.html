<h2 style = "font-family:georgia,garamond,serif;font-size:30px;font-style:italic;">Are they Endangered?</h2>
	<p style = "font-family:georgia,garamond,serif;font-size:20px;font-style:italic;">Polar bears are classified as a vulnerable species by the World Wildlife Foundation and have been on the United States’ Endangered Species list as “threatened” since 2008. Polar bears are marine animals that spend more than half their time hunting for food on the ice of the Arctic Ocean. Their high-fat diet consists primarily of seal meat, and a polar bear is lucky to catch one in every five seals it goes after. As climate change decimates the polar bear’s available hunting territory, polar bears are having a hard time finding enough food. It is especially perilous for bears on dry land, like the polar bear in the viral video. They are marine animals after all, who move and hunt more efficiently in water. Polar bears are also hunted in a long-standing Inuit tradition. A polar bear skin goes for $10,000 or more, while the meat is divided up and shared for food. The Canadian government is hesitant to make the traditional hunt illegal for cultural reasons but have imposed rules and restrictions to avoid overhunting.</p>
