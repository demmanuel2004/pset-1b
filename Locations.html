	<p style = "font-family:georgia,garamond,serif;font-size:20px;font-style:italic;">Polar bears live in the circumpolar north, in areas where they can hunt their primary prey. Polar bears primary prey is seals, but normally polar bears will eat anything they can find. Polar bears are found in Canada, Alaska, Greenland, Russia and Norway (the Svalbard archipelago). Scientists have identified 19 populations of polar bears living in four different sea ice regions across the Arctic. Polar bears inhabit a lot of places, but are all found in places that are very cold.</p>
